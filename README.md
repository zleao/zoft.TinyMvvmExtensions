# zoft.TinyMvvmExtensions

Extension library built on top of the awesome TinyMvvm library. Similar approach to what I've done in the [MvxExtensions](https://github.com/zleao/MvvmCross-Extensions/tree/master/Libraries/MvxExtensions) library. Provides extra functionalites for ViewModels.

### A bit of context:

This project is part of the **zoft** library, which is nothing more than an attempt to put together a set of C# utilities that I've created in my current and past projects.

A lot of this code comes from another library I've developed over the years ([MvxExtensions](https://github.com/zleao/MvvmCross-Extensions)). This library was initialy built to provide some extensions and utilities that work on top of awesome [MvvmCross](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross)... but then it came a time to change and here we are. **zoft** is my attempt to extend the awesome [TinyMvvm](https://github.com/TinyStuff/TinyMvvm) library in the same way I did for MvvmCross. It starts with code ported from MvxExtentions but it will not stop there...

##

### Samples are comming to better explain how to use the library. In the meantime, you can check how to get started with [TinyMvvm](https://github.com/TinyStuff/TinyMvvm). There won't be to much changes to incorporate this library.
